            Long Beach Island is where Ive spent 
            almost every weekend of my whole life. We have a little house 
            by the beach that has been in the family for generations.
            The waves are great for swimming, boogie- 
            boarding, surfing, etc. The sand is soft, the water is clear, 
            the people are nice, and the vibes are flowing. I met my best 
            friends at LBI, Adriana and Brooke. They visit less often then 
            my family so im always looking forward to seeing them.

            Every February break for the past 5 years 
            or so, my family has spent a week on the beaches 
            of Cape Canaveral, (3 weeks during 2020). 
            The waves are amazing; not rough at all but 
            great for surfing. Part of the reason I love it 
            so much is because it reminds me of Long Beach Island, 
            my favorite place in the whole world.
          </td>
          <td>
            Before we discovered the wondrous 
            Cape Canaveral, my family would stay in 
            Cocoa Beach. Its another lovely 
            place in Florida with amazing surf waves, 
            a fun pier, and the world famous <em>Ron John Surf Shop.</em>
            Every year we rent bikes and ride down to the pier 
            and surf shop.

            My favoite beach in New York City is 
            Jones beach, because it usually has good 
            waves and (imo) is one of the least polluted 
            beaches in the city. I love to take my city 
            friends to Jones Beach during the summer 
            and its always really nice.

     My favorite resturants and cafes in LBI are Kubels, Agnello's, How You Brewin, 
     Holiday Snackbar, and Panzones. Most of these places I discovered through 
     my friends, Adriana and Brooke. We love going out to eat at Holiday Snackbar 
     where we get Burgers or Panzones where we get Pizza. We also love going to How 
     You Brewin or Agnello's to get bagels, sandwitches, fried chicken, cokes, 
     and chai tea lattes. <br>
      <br>
    My favorite places to go when im in Long Beach Island is the lighthouse, 
      the Barnegat Light Playground, the 17th street Beach, or Fantasy Island (Amusement Park and arcade.)
      I recommend them all!

      The sunlight shines through the bushes outside my window and onto my face. I sit up and check my watch, it 
      reads; 10:27. Its time for my morning walk on the beach. <br>
      I pull back the covers and slip my feet into my crocs. <br>
      Walking into my parents room I see my mom laying in bed, reading a book, my fluffy beach dog sits next
      to her. <br>
      "Wanna go for a walk Toby?" I ask my dog. He jumps on me, wagging his tail and trying to lick my face.
      My mom laughs, "I think that means 'yes.'" <br>
      
      After my oatmeal breakfast, I check 'Surfline', my favorite surf app that tells me the quality of the waves.<br>
     It tells me <em> 'poor to fair'</em> from 9:00-12:00.<em> I have to get out there soon before I miss my chance,</em> I think. <br>
     I turn to my brother, Axel, who's eating a chocolate croissant next to me, "wanna go for a swim?," I ask him. <br>
      
     Just as me and Axel are walking back to the house, we run into my parents with our dog! <br>
      "You guys wanna go Kayaking?"
      My dad helps me carry the board back home, we shower off, and get dressed to take the boats out on the bay.<br>
      
      After Kayaking down the current for an hour, we dock at the stretch of island called 'The Dike' and take a break. <br>
      Were too tired to paddle back so my mom walks back to get the car. We load the Kayaks onto the car and drive home. <br>
      
      After a small snack, Axel and I decide to go for a bike ride to see the sunset. 
      
      When we get back to the house, dinnner is ready! We have grilled salmon, potatoes, and squash; made on our outdoor grill. <br>
      After dinner we pack the car and drive back to NYC for another 5 days of school before Im back at the beach. <br>
      Next weekend, Adriana and Brooke are coming down! Im so exited!💙🌊
