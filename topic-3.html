            The sunlight shines through the bushes outside my window and onto my
            face. I sit up and check my watch, it reads; 10:27. Its time for my
            morning walk on the beach. <br />
            I pull back the covers and slip my feet into my crocs. <br />
            Walking into my parents room I see my mom laying in bed, reading a
            book and petting my fluffy dog. <br />
            "Wanna go for a walk Toby?" I ask him. He jumps on me, wagging his
            tail and trying to lick my face. My mom laughs, "I think that means
            'yes.'" <br />

            After my oatmeal breakfast, I check 'Surfline', my favorite surf app
            that tells me the quality of the waves.<br />
            It tells me <em> 'poor to fair'</em> from 9:00-12:00.<em>
              I have to get out there soon before I miss my chance,</em
            >
            I think. <br />
            I turn to my brother, Axel, who's eating a chocolate croissant next
            to me, "wanna go for a swim?," I ask him. <br />

            Just as me and Axel are walking back to the house, we run into my
            parents with the dog! <br />
            "We were thinking about taking the Kayaks out. Are you guys
            interested in coming with?" <br />
            "YES!" we tell them. <br />
            My dad helps me carry the surf board back home, we shower off, get
            dressed, and drive the boats down to the bay.<br />

            After Kayaking down the current for a few hours, we dock at the
            stretch of island called 'The Dike', and my mom goes to get the car.
            <br />
            We load the Kayaks onto the car and drive back to the house. <br />

            After a small snack, Axel and I decide to go for a bike ride to see
            the sunset. When we get back to the house, dinnner is ready! We have
            grilled salmon, potatoes, and squash; made on the outdoor grill.
